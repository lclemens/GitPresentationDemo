This is the story of the Allard Lab Lobster.

Once upon a time, there was a lobster living in Boston.
This lobster was very happy in Boston, but he kept hearing rumors of his friends disappearing.
The tales were gruesome.  
There were stories of being SNIC BIFURCATED in HOMOCLINIC ORBITS from their WEIGHTED ENSEMBLE METHODS.
There were stories of getting stuck in cages while foraging for food.
The other lobsters would share their theories of what happened to these lobsters when they vanished.
Some thought that they were called to the heart of the ocean by the bubbling of mantis shrimp.
Some believed they were boiled alive and devoured by the large land monsters.
The most optimistic believed they joined their deity in the sky: Jibbers Crabst.
But the truth was clear:  No lobster was safe.

Now the lobster in our tale heard all of these stories and feared for his life.
Particularly since he was living in a place where many of the large land monsters passed through every day.
But one day, one of the land monsters approached him. 
The land monster offered to take him away from Boston to a place where he could sit and watch other land monsters stare at giant screens for hours upon hours.
This sounded like a better offer than waiting to Vanish like so many of his friends, so the Lobster accepted.
To this day, he sits comfortable and safe in a room that smells of coffee and cheerful grad students.

And that is the story of the Allard Lab Lobster.
